# Deep-Convolutional-Generative-Adversarial-Network-DCGAN-using-PyTorch

Deeper understanding of the process of creating and training a GAN model. Specifically: 

- Use the DataLoader class to load the dataset into batches 
- Create a discriminator network and a generator network 
- Understand the training loop and the steps involved in training a GAN model
